🎬 IMDB Movies Data Analysis using SQL

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing IMDB movie data using SQL to uncover key insights about movies, directors, popularity, and profitability. The analysis aimed to understand the relationships between movies, directors, genres, and performance metrics through a series of SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, filtering, and pattern-based data extraction.

🎯 Key Objectives

Explore and analyze movie and director data using SQL queries.
Identify the most popular and most bankable movies.
Determine the most successful directors based on the number of movies and total profit.
Apply data extraction, filtering, and aggregation techniques to gain business insights.

🧰 Tools & Technologies

 MySQL – For query execution and analysis.
SQL Concepts Used: Aggregations, Group By, Pattern Matching, and Filtering Clauses.
Dataset: IMDB movie dataset containing movie details, director information, and revenue data.

💡 Key Insights
